#ðŸ”’Python File Lock
Quantum-Resistant 5-Layer Encryption Program
Python File Lock is FREE, advanced, semi-open-source (program code is viewable) File Encryption and Decryption Software designed to provide exceptional Quantum-resistant security for sensitive data. Utilizing a unique 4-layer Multi-Encryption approach, this program offers resistance against attacks from both current and future supercomputers and quantum computers.

Features

4-layer encryption: Fernet, AES-256-CBC, ChaCha20-Poly1305, and XOR
Quantum-resistant encryption engine
Straightforward user interface
Automatic encryption and decryption process
Open-source (with restrictions, see License)

How to use:
Install Instructions

Run the program
Choose to encrypt or decrypt a file
Enter your password
Select the file to encrypt/decrypt
The program will automatically process the file and output the result

Password Recommendations
For generating a strong password, we recommend using KeePass, an open-source password manager. KeePass can generate high-entropy passwords that significantly enhance the security of your encrypted files.
Security
Python File Lock uses a combination of strong encryption algorithms and a multi-layer approach to provide robust security:

Fernet (AES-128-CBC with HMAC-SHA256)
AES-256-CBC
ChaCha20-Poly1305
XOR with a random key

This combination is designed to resist attacks from current supercomputers and remain secure against potential quantum computer attacks in the future.
Limitations
Remember that the security of your encrypted files ultimately depends on the strength of your password. Always use a strong, unique password for each encrypted file.
